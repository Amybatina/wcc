        She sells sea-shells on the sea-shore,
        The shells she sells are sea-shells, I'm sure
        For if she sells sea-shells on the sea-shore
        Then I'm sure she sells sea-shore shells.

    Mary Anning was a self-taught fossil collector who is most well known for all the important items she found.  In addition to the ichthyosaurs, she found a plesiosaurs, a pterodactyl and hundreds of other fossils.  Her finds made primarily in the Jurassic marine fossil beds along the English Channel helped scientists form ideas about prehistoric life and the history of the Earth. Her story was the inspiration for the tongue twister "She sells seashelss on the seashore".
